<h1 align="center"> Gaming </h1>

<p>

I love gaming. Gaming allows for a person to let loose on all the tensions of the world and focus on something light for some time. As I attend Marianopolis College the world load tends to be quite heavy. At times I stay up late studying or finishing up assignments. The constant need to put soo much effort into everything I do tends to lead me towards burning out and not wanting to work anymore. The solution for me is games.

Games are competitive in nature and allows for a person t focus on anything other than the stressful work in their everyday lives. I myself tend to paly games on the weekend to sort of cool down from all the work I do over the week. I play games like Minecraft and Fortnite and these games are a great way for me to destress and get ready to work on Monday when the school week starts again.
