This is where I had mimicked my schedule for the fall 2020 semester using tables in html:
<br>
<div align="center">
<a href="exercise1.html">Exercise 1</a>
</div>
<br>
This is where I had created two tables with images inside of them, both tables were the same, one used the images regularly and the other used it as a background image:
<div align="center">
<br>
<a href="exercise2.html">Exercise 2</a>
</div>
