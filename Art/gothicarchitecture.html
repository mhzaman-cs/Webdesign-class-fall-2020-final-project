This amazing architecture is known as the Duomo, Florence's cathedral is famous for its incredible dome, built by Filippo Brunelleschi. Its construction began in 1296 in the Gothic style architecture the structure wasn't complete until 1436. The multicolor paintings that we see today weren’t completed until 1887 in the neo-Gothic style. Florence Cathedral, formally known as the Cattedrale di Santa Maria del Fiore in English "Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Flower", is the cathedral in Florence, Italy. The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink, bordered by white, and has an elaborate 19th-century Gothic Revival façade by Emilio De Fabris. The cathedral complex, in Piazza del Duomo, includes the Baptistery and Giotto's Campanile. All three of these buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major tourist attraction for people to tour. Obviously now because of Covid-19 not many people show up. The basilica is one of Italy's largest churches, and until the development of new structural materials in the modern era, the dome was the largest in the world. It remains the largest brick dome ever constructed. All these amazing facts about this huge cathedral makes me believe that it is a beautiful piece of art. I believe that such art should be represented so I have added it on to my website.
