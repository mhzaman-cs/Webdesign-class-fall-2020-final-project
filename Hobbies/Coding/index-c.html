<h1 align="center"> Coding </h1>
<hr>
<p>
I like coding because it is fun. It provides for an activity which is both challenging and interesting. It allows a person to understand what goes on in the back end of software. It allows for innovation by giving more flexibility to students in terms of allowing them to make what they want. Personally, I had started to code in python. I liked python because it was simple, yet its libraries allowed for soo many functionalities. I had taken 2 python courses over the summer of 2020.

<br>
I had completed a Course on Udemy called “Complete Python Bootcamp: Go from zero to hero in Python 3”. This is a course containing 24 hours of video content and many homework assignments, quizzes and projects related to python. The course content starts off by teaching very basic python such as data structure basics, operators, methods, and functions. The course continued by teaching Object Oriented programing, errors and exception handling, python generators and decorators, GUIs and much more.

<br>
The second course I had completed was a Data Science course on Udemy. This is a course containing 25 hours of video content related to how to use the most common python data science libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly and Scikit-Learn. It also teaches supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms such as linear regression, logistic regression, k nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SMVs), K means clustering and much more.

<br>
Overall I really like coding, especially in python.
