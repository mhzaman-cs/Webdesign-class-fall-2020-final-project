Computer software refers to programs and other operating information that computers use to function. Software is a compilation of clear instructions that tells the hardware to perform specific tasks that it was designed for.
Software is a program that enables a computer to perform a specific task, as opposed to the physical components of the system (hardware).
This includes application software such as a word processor, which enables a user to perform a task, and system software such as an operating system, which enables other software to run properly, by interfacing with hardware and with other software.
