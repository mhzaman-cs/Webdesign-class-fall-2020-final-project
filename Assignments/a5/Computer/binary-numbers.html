In mathematics and digital electronics, a binary number is a number expressed in the base-2 numeral system or binary numeral system, which uses only two symbols: typically "0" (zero) and "1" (one). The base-2 numeral system is a positional notation with a radix of 2. Each digit is referred to as a bit. Because of its straightforward implementation in digital electronic circuitry using logic gates, the binary system is used by almost all modern computers and computer-based devices.
A binary number is a positional numeral system with two as the base. The binary number system consists of two different numerals, namely zero and one. These can be used to represent all other numbers. As it has the advantages of easy implementation by logic gates, it is mostly used in electronic and computer-based devices, networking and digital signal processing.
