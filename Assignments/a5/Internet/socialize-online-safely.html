<p>Social networkers beware: digital communities are facing increased online threats. The accessibility and popularity of networking sites are among the main reasons that these communities are targeted by malware, extortion scams and impersonation ploys. Keep these essentials in mind as you socialize online.

Be careful what you post. Once shared online, your private information is no longer private. Before posting any personal information, think about how much data you want available about yourself online. Be careful what you consume – Don’t click on unsolicited messages. You’ve heard this security mantra applied to e-mail, but it pertains to social networking sites as well. The catch: you’ll also need to watch for imposters; you have to be careful even when links appear to come from a friend. Scammers can easily hack into accounts in order to send messages that appear as though they’re from a friend.</p>
