Sydney Opera House sits on Bennelong Point in Australia. Bennelong Point was named after Woollarawarre Bennelong, a senior Eora man at the time of the arrival of British colonizers in Australia in 1788. The original cost estimate to build Sydney Opera House was $7 million but after the final cost was $102 million and it was largely paid for by a State Lottery. There were about 233 designs were submitted for the Opera House international design competition held in 1956. Jorn Utzon from Denmark was announced the winner after winning the competition. He recived 5000 pounds for his design. Construction was expected to take four years, but it took 14 years. Work started in 1959 and involved 10,000 construction workers. Paul Robeson was the first person to perform at Sydney Opera House. In 1960, he climbed the scaffolding and sang Ol' Man River to the construction workers as they ate lunch. The Sydney Opera House was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2007 There are more than 1 million roof tiles covering approximately 1.62 hectares sitting over the structure. After reading all these facts online I find that this is very cool and interesting. It us now one of my favourite peices of art in the entire world, because of that I put it on my website.
