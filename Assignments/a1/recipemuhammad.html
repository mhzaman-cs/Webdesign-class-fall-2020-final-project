This recipe takes around 15 minutes to prepare and 15 minutes to cook, adding up to 30 minutes in total. It has 8 servings and has around 335 calories per serving.
Here are the ingredients:

<br>
<br>

<ul>
<li>16 ounces wide rice noodles</li>
<li>8 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce</li>
<li>4 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
<li>4 tablespoons vinegar</li>
<li>6 tablespoons honey</li>
<li>8 teaspoon chili flakes</li>
<li>Half a cup of chili oil</li>
<li>8-pound raw jumbo shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
<li>6 tablespoons peanut oil</li>
<li>12 cloves garlic be sure to finely chopped</li>
<li>6 tablespoons salted butter</li>
<li>6 eggs be sure to beat them</li>
<li>4 cups bean sprouts or chopped baby bok choy</li> 
<li>8 green onions, chopped, plus more for serving</li>
<li>0.5 cup roasted peanuts, chopped</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

To start off cook the rice noodles according to the directions written on your rice noodle package. If your package does not have instructions, then you can cook the noodles Muhammadâ€™s special way. To make the noodles my way simply boil them in twice as much water as there are noodles, for example: if there are 16 ounces of noodles then boil them in 32 ounces of water. Boil them for 6 minutes.  

<br>
<br>

After you boil the noodles you have to make the sauce. To make the sauce of the pad thai, combine the soy sauce, fish sauce, vinegar, honey, chili flakes and chili oil in a small bowl. After that, heat up the peanut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil starts to simmer, add the shrimp and cook on both sides until it turns pink. This should take you around 2-3 minutes. 

<br>
<br>

After your shrimp is done cooking add the butter, garlic, and black pepper. Continue to cook the shrimp in the butter until the garlic begins to caramelize and turn light golden brown. This should take another 1-2 minutes. After that add the noodles and sauce into the same bowl. Make sure you toss to combine them very well. 

<br>
<br>

Put them back on the pan and cook until the noodles are warmed. Make sure the noodles start to soak up the sauce. This should take you another minute or so. Then mix all six of your eggs well together. Push the noodles to one side of the skillet and add the eggs to the other side. Let cook until the edges start to set. This should also be for another minute. Remove the pad thai from the heat. Add the bean sprouts and green onions. Divide the noodles and shrimp between plates. Top all the plates with basil, green onions, peanuts, and chili flakes and add a squeeze of lime juice. Then you are done. Enjoy your meal.
