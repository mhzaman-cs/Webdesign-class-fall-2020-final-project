Computer hardware refers to the physical parts that make up the entirety of a computer. Hardware includes the electrical, mechanical, data storage and magnetic components among other parts.
<br>
Hardware is typically directed by the software to execute any command or instruction. A combination of hardware and software forms a usable computing system, although other systems exist with only hardware.
One type of computer hardware is input devices. Input devices refers to any type of machine that feeds data into a computer. Examples of input devices include keyboards, monitors, and mice.
Hardware is so-termed because it is "hard" or rigid with respect to changes, whereas software is "soft" because it is easy to change.
