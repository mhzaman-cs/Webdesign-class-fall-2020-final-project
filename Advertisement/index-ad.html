<blockquote>
Color pencils in different sizes and shapes are great. They help bring out creativity and therefore make a person more innovative. The best color pencils in the entire world are Crayola color pencils. But that is not because of the quality or quantity of the color pencils you get; it is actually because of the amazing pencil sharpener that you get with it. In my eyes that is the best sharpener in the entire world. It sharpens a pencil really well making it extremely pointy thus allowing to draw, color, or even poke someone really well. This sharper even sharpens dollar store pencils who would always break otherwise if we had used other color pencils. So buy this amazing Crayola color set not just for the variety of the color pencils but mostly for the free but prefect sharpener that comes with it.
