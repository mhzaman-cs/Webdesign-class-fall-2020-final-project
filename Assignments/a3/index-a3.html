Here are the two thing that were created in Assignment 3:
<br>
<blockquote>
First of all, I created an art page with 2 different types of art. For the first art piece I had chosen Gothic Architecture. Gothic architecture is a European style of architecture that values height and is very fancy and delicate. For my second art piece I had chosen Modern architecture. Modern architecture is also known as modernist architecture is an architectural style based upon new and innovative technologies of construction. It uses a lot of glass, steel, and reinforced by concrete. I found that both were really amazing, and I learned a lot about architecture from this assignment. Here is the link to the Art page:

<blockquote>The second thing that I had created for this assignment was that I had made an Advertisement. This advertisement was really interesting as it had featured a set of color pencils and also displayed many colors. I had used a mapped image to map out all the important parts of the color pencil case. The things that I had highlighted were the sharpener, the name, and the number of pencils in the case. This would be very helpful for those people who would have trouble reading it when is sort of small on the index page. The zoom ins really helped the reader focus on one thing.
